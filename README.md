# Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-machine-learning ü©∫
# OVERVIEW
A machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of a disease 9heart disease) based on patient data such as age, gender, medical history, cholestrol etc features.
a machine learning project designed to predict diseases based on patient health data. The model is trained using classification techniques to analyze symptoms/medical attributes and provide predictions that can assist in healthcare diagnostics.
# üöÄ Features

Data preprocessing and cleaning for health-related datasets Training ML models for disease prediction Model evaluation with accuracy and metrics 
with Accuracy 84% 

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visual insights into data distribution, correlations, and feature patterns.

Model Training: Includes Random Forest (or your algorithm of choice) for classification.

Model Persistence: Trained model and scaler saved using joblib (i.e., heart_scaler.pkl, heart_rf_model.pkl).

Prediction API: Script/module for making inferences on new data inputs.

Evaluation Metrics: Includes accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC curve, and feature importance insights.
